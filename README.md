# CityScope
CityScope unifies and visualizes previously disparate pieces of information for any county in the United States. From poverty rates to natural disaster trends to farmers market densities, we provide a multifaceted resource for travelers as well as a locus of realtime information for residents. In particular, census data on demographics and trends is colored by input from social media APIs, resulting in a vivid representation of any locale.
